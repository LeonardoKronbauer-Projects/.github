# LeonardoKronbauer-Projects üìÑ

Welcome to the **LeonardoKronbauer-Projects** organization! This space was created to store and organize all of my academic projects, including my bachelor's thesis, scientific articles, research projects, and other works related to the field of Information Systems.

## About üß†

This organization serves as a central repository for all my academic work, allowing me to keep my research and documents in one place. Each repository within this organization represents a specific project, whether it's an article, a research project, or a thesis, with all the necessary LaTeX files, figures, data, and references for reproduction and understanding.

## Structure üóÇÔ∏è

The structure of the organization is simple and intuitive:
- **Repositories**: Each repository contains a specific project, with its own set of files, from the LaTeX source code to the compiled PDFs.
- **Documentation**: Relevant documentation for each project, including detailed READMEs, explanations, and usage instructions, is included in each repository.

## Purpose üéØ

The purpose of this organization is not only to store and manage my academic projects but also to share knowledge and contribute to the scientific community. All repositories are organized to facilitate access, understanding, and reuse of the works stored here.

## Contact üì¨

Feel free to explore the repositories and reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or interest in collaborating on future projects.
